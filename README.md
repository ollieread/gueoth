## FAQ

### What's with the name?
Gueoth is pronounced the same way as 'git'. It's a creative spelling utilising some 
weird and wonderful parts of the English language.
 
 - **GUE** as in dialo**GUE**
 - **O** as in w**O**men
 - **TH** as in **TH**yme
 
### Why did you create this?
We're all on lockdown, and I honestly needed something to distract me from the never
ending loop of cbeebies while I wasn't working. Also because I hadn't done it before,
and it seemed like it would be fun.
